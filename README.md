# Shopathon

Shopathon is a React Native mobile application that hits a RESTful api for the backend functionality and data storage.
The app is a shopping list that allows you to add pictures of coupons so that you can scan the barcodes straight off
of your phone instead of having to carry tons of coupons to the store. 
The app can be viewed via the expo app at https://exp.host/@itsajoe/this-project.
